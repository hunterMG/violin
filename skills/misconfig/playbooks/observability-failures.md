# Observability Failures — Playbook

## Vulnerability Description

**OWASP:** A09:2021 — Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
**CWE:** CWE-532 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File), CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information)

Observability failures occur when an application leaks sensitive information through its monitoring, logging, or metrics infrastructure. Attackers can exploit exposed endpoints to learn about internal architecture, discovered credentials, user activity patterns, and system configuration.
---

## Types

| Type | Description | Common Endpoints |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Access Log Disclosure** | Application logs (with IPs, user agents, paths, query params) are publicly accessible | `/logs`, `/access.log`, `/var/log`, `/api/logs` |
| **Metrics Exposure** | Prometheus/OpenMetrics endpoints exposed without authentication | `/metrics`, `/api/metrics`, `/actuator/prometheus` |
| **Health/Info Endpoints** | Actuator/health endpoints leaking environment info | `/actuator`, `/health`, `/info`, `/env`, `/heapdump` |
| **SIEM Rule/Signature Disclosure** | Security monitoring rules, detection signatures, or error patterns are exposed | Signature files, YAML/XML detection rule files |
| **Stack Trace Exposure** | Error messages reveal full stack traces with file paths and code snippets | 500 error pages, API error responses |
| **Debug Mode** | Production running in debug mode with verbose output | `/debug`, `?debug=true` parameter, `X-Debug: true` header |
| **Leaked Credentials via Logs** | Passwords, tokens, or secrets visible in log entries | Log aggregation dashboards, log files, cloud logging services |

## Detection

### Metrics Endpoints

```bash
# Common Prometheus metrics paths
for path in /metrics /api/metrics /actuator/prometheus /prometheus /stats /api/stats; do
  code=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" "https://target.com$path")
  echo "$path → $code"
done

# If metrics are exposed, check for sensitive data
curl -s "https://target.com/metrics" | grep -E "(password|secret|key|token|credential|email)" | head -10

# Check for application-specific metrics that reveal business data
curl -s "https://target.com/metrics" | grep -E "(user|order|payment|product)_(count|total|sum)" | head -10
```

### Access Log Disclosure

```bash
# Common log file paths
for path in /logs /access.log /error.log /var/log /api/logs /log /logging; do
  code=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" "https://target.com$path")
  echo "$path → $code"
done

# Check for log download endpoints
curl -s "https://target.com/api/logs" | head -5

# Look for logs in exposed directories
curl -s "https://target.com/ftp/" | grep -iE "(log|audit|access|error)"
```

### Stack Trace / Error Disclosure

```bash
# Trigger errors to see stack traces
curl -s "https://target.com/api/Products/abc" | head -20
curl -s "https://target.com/rest/user/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test","password":"test"}' | head -20

# Check for debug parameters
curl -s "https://target.com/?debug=true"
curl -s -H "X-Debug: true" "https://target.com/"
```

### Actuator/Spring Boot Endpoints

```bash
for path in /actuator /actuator/health /actuator/info /actuator/env /actuator/beans \
  /actuator/configprops /actuator/mappings /actuator/heapdump /actuator/threaddump; do
  code=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" "https://target.com$path")
  echo "$path → $code"
done
```

---

## Safe Proof of Concept

```bash
# Safe: Demonstrate metrics endpoint exposure
curl -s "https://target.com/metrics" | head -20

# Safe: Show that a log file is accessible (do NOT download entire log)
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code} %{size_download}bytes" "https://target.com/access.log"

# Safe: Trigger a controlled error and show stack trace snippet
curl -s "https://target.com/api/Products/invalid" 2>&1 | grep -oE "(Error:|at |Stack:|line [0-9]+)" | head -5
```

**Safe PoC rules:**
- Do NOT download or exfiltrate entire log files — prove access with headers/partial content
- Do NOT use stack trace information to escalate further without authorization
- Report metrics exposure without abusing the data

## Evidence

```
**Vulnerability:** Observability Failure — Metrics Endpoint Exposed
**URL:** https://target.com/metrics
**Type:** Unauthenticated Prometheus Metrics

**Evidence:**
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Content-Type: text/plain

  # HELP file_uploads_count Total number of successful file uploads
  # TYPE file_uploads_count counter
  file_uploads_count{file_type="text/html"} 5

  # HELP http_requests_total Total HTTP requests
  # TYPE http_requests_total counter
  http_requests_total{method="POST",path="/api/login"} 1423

**Impact:** Business metrics leaked — file upload types, request patterns, user counts.
**Remediation:** Add authentication to metrics endpoints. Restrict to internal network.
```

## Stop Conditions
- Generic baseline — see `references/shared-safety.md` §Generic Stop Conditions (pause on unexpected behavior, scope breach, or WAF/IDS trip).

## Blocked Actions
- Generic baseline — see `.hermes.md` §Forbidden Behaviour (destructive DB ops, exfiltration beyond PoC, persistence, lateral movement all prohibited there).

## Remediation

| Measure | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Authenticate monitoring endpoints** | Require authentication for /metrics, /health, /actuator, /logs |
| **Network restriction** | Expose monitoring endpoints only on internal/VPN networks |
| **Mask sensitive data in logs** | Never log passwords, tokens, PII, or payment data |
| **Structured logging** | Use structured logging with security context (trace IDs for auditing) |
| **No debug in production** | Disable debug mode, stack traces, and verbose error messages in production |
| **Log rotation and retention** | Implement log rotation with appropriate retention periods |
| **SIEM integration** | Forward security-relevant events to SIEM with alerting on suspicious patterns |
